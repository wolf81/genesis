# GENESIS

Genesis is a Lua / LÃ–VE2D based world generator. My goals with Genesis are:

* To have a library that can be easily integrated into games
* To be able to generate interesting random patterns
* Worlds should be seedable: the same seed value should generate the same world
* Worlds should be easily usable with cubemaps
* Worlds should have biomes, rivers, seas, lakes, mountains
* Allow some configuration of the generator, e.g. detail level

# FURTHER READING

The Genesis source code is based on a variety of ideas and posts found on the 
internet. For reference I've added the most important links here.
